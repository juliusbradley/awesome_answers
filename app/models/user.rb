class User < ApplicationRecord
  # if you add an attribute accessor to an ActiveRecord object then you will be
   # able to capture that from the form and have it in memory but it will not be
   # stored in the database if you don't have a database field for it
   # attr_accessor :abc
   # we don't have to do this for 'password and 'password_confirmation' if we use
   # f.password_field beause Rails automatically adds attribute accessors for these
   #two special fields

   # has_secure_password is a built-in Rails method that helps us with user
  # authentication.
  # 1. It will automatically add a presence validator for the password field
  # 2. When given a password it will generate a salt then it will hash the salt
  #    and password combo and will store the result of the Hashing (using
  #    bcrypt) along with the randomly generated salt into a database field
  #    called `password_digest`
  # 3. If you skip `password_confirmation` field then it won't give you a
  #    a validation errors for that. If you provide `password_confirmation` then
  #    it will validate that the password matches the password_confirmation
  # 4. We will get a method called `authenticate` that will help us test if the
 #    user has entered the correct password or not.
